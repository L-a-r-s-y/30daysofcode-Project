              A username is a name that uniquely identifies someone on a
              computer system. For example, a computer may be setup with
              multiple accounts, with different usernames for each account.

              A reminder of how a password was derived. In order to jog the
              user's memory, some login systems allow a hint to be entered,
              which is displayed each time the password is requested. For
              example, if the password contains the date of someone's birthday,
              one might enter the name of the person as the hint.

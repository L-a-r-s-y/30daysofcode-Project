        <h1>Build a table of contents</h1>
        <p>
          A table of contents, usually headed simply Contents and abbreviated
          informally as TOC, is a list, usually found on a page before the start
          of a written work, of its chapter or section titles or brief
          descriptions with their commencing page numbers.

          If you're wondering how to write a table of contents, the first
          decision you have to make is a matter of depth. How detailed do you
          want (or need) to be? Will a broad chapter summation work? Or, will
          you want to offer various subsections, too?

          Here, we have a single level table of contents for individual sections
          of the work, or individual chapters. You'll want to include a series
          of dots to make it easier for the reader's eye to note the
          corresponding page number.

        <p>
          Given that the contents above covers an expansive array of
          information, you might want to break some of those sections into
          subsections. The formatting for that would.

          Of course, you can continue to include as many subheadings as you
          need. If you go in-depth into the various types of nouns, verbs,
          adjectives, and adverbs, then you can include each type as its own
          subheading.

          Just note that, while the table of contents is meant to direct the
          readers, you only want to highlight the most important sections. Too
          many levels can make things unnecessarily complex, voiding the purpose
          of the table of contents.

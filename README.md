# 30DaysOfCode

Series of projects which I plan on building for the next 30 days without fail ü§®

## Day 1: Bin2Dec

Built a Binary 2 Decimal converter

![Bin2Dec](./day-01/Bin2Dec.gif)

### What I learned so far (Pros)

- I learned the `parseInt()` function and how it takes in string/number argument and returns an integer of the specified `radix` (the base in mathematical numeral systems)
- In the above app I passed a `radix` or `base` of 2 specifying functions should return a Decimal value

### What I should've also done (Con's)

- I should've added regex validation for the input field rather than `alert`ing a message when keycode is not `0 or 1`

## Day 2: Border Radius Previewer

Built a Border Radius Previewer
